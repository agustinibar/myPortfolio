      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Professional Profile</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        I'm a 26-year-old technology enthusiast with a strong background in teamwork, gained during my years in rugby, and a successful career as an executive chef in the gastronomy industry. My journey into technology started with a latent interest, which eventually led me to immerse myself in the world of web development and programming.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Gastronomy Experience</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        I began my career as a dishwasher and, over four years, rose to the position of executive chef, overseeing seven kitchens and leading a team of 60 people. During this time, I reached and exceeded all the goals I had set for myself. This experience taught me the importance of adaptability and team management in a multicultural and dynamic environment.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Transition to Technology</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        My passion for technology ultimately led me to make a career shift. I started with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap before joining Henry, where I gained skills in Javascript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and more. The most valuable thing I gained was the ability to work effectively in remote teams, an essential skill in the post-pandemic era.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Focused on the Future</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Currently, after graduating from Henry, I am focused on learning Python, with a particular emphasis on cybersecurity, a field that has always intrigued me. My chameleon-like ability, honed during my time as a chef, allows me to adapt easily to different environments and challenges, which I consider a key advantage in the ever-evolving technology landscape.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        I am excited to continue my career in the technology industry, taking on new challenges and achieving even more ambitious goals. My background in teamwork, my ability to adapt to any environment, and my passion for technology make me a valuable asset to any IT team.
